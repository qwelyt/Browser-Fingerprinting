		<h2>About us</h2>

		<p>
		We are two students at the Computer Systems and Science department of Stockholm University in Sweden currently undertaking a preparatory course for writing our bachelor's thesis. 
		As part of this course, we are supposed to write a 'mini-thesis'. This survey is intended to help gather data for that paper.
		</p>

		<h2>About the tests</h2>

		<p>
		The tests performed create a fingerprint of your browser by checking how it uses the HTML5 <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element to render different fonts and, if possible, a WebGL model. 
		It then compares your rendered elements to other people's elements and sees how unique they are. 
		How unique they are defines how easily identifiable your browser fingerprint is.
		</p>

		<p>
		The six tests are further defined and described in section 3.1 of the report ''Pixel Perfect: Fingerprinting Canvas in HTML5'' by Keaton Mowery and Hovav Shacham at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of the University of California in San Diego.
		The report can be found here: <a href='http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~hovav/dist/canvas.pdf'>http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~hovav/dist/canvas.pdf</a>

			For research purposes, we store the result data from the tests, as well as a cookie to help identify returning devices. 
			For control purposes, browser version and operating system version information is also saved.
			None of the stored data can on its own be used to identify any individual visitors to the site. 
			The data will only be used to calculate an estimate of the entropy (uniqueness) of the fingerprints generated by the different tests. 
			For an explanation on entropy and browser fingerprinting, see <a href='https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/01/primer-information-theory-and-privacy'>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/01/primer-information-theory-and-privacy</a>

		<h2>Technologies</h2>


		<p>
			The website is written in HTML, with the tests in JavaScript using PHP to save the data to a MySQL database.
